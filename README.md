### The Matlab code I wrote to compute the speckle modulation for the publication:

#### Mike Adams, Alex Matov, Daphne Yarar, Steph Gupton, Gaudy Danuser, Clare Waterman "Signal Analysis of Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Speckle Microscopy and Wide-Field Epi-Fluorescence FSM of the Actin Cytoskeleton and Focal Adhesions in Living Cells (2004)"

### Provides the number of speckles in a ROIs and their mean modulation; getModulation.m is the main function
